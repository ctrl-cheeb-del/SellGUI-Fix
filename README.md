# About

The plugin developed by aoov is a simple selling plugin with many features such as custom items
and more. However this plugin is discontinued for later version and has some issues around selling all player items and the estimated value.
This is just a project to publish a fix for newer version if anyone else needed it.

Depends on the [Spigot API](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and [Vault API](https://github.com/MilkBowl/VaultAPI) for core functionality.
Has integrations with EssentialsX for pricing.
